So these are going to be my experimental unit (yes, I know they are technically 3 underworld warbands).
Every time I try and pick up an new technique or method or idea, these will be the unit that they'll be universally applied to in the hope that when I'm done, I'll end up with a nifty looking, themed unit. 

I've started off with vivid yellow. Something that traditionally, paint doesn't do all that great by itself. 

To start with, these were all undercoated in a bright bubblegum pink spray and then given a zenithal white highlight. 

I then applied two; or three layers of a vibrant yellow ink over this. Due to the strength of the pigment in the ink, it tints the pink underpaint to a warm orange type colour after a few coats which helps achieve a nice blend between the shade and highlights. This is further re-enforced by a wash of Cassandora yellow. Whilst my shoddy photos don't quite do it justice, I think the balance and exposure is off a bit, these do have quite a nice transition from the right angles which is a much more natural effect that I've achieved in the past with this type of shading and highlight as the transitions really are just feeding off the zenithal highlights that were applied.

I think that so far this has given me quite a solid start for a golden themed unit. I'm going to try some armour weathering, maybe some NMM and a few other more time consuming effects once I've decided what to apply where on them. At least I've got a few goes should something go wrong!

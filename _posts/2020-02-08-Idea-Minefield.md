So I had an idea. 

I'm pretty sure I've heard the term mind palace before. I understand the concept but also accept that the practicalites of it are left primarily to fictional entities. 

I'm going for something far less structured, something I'm terming an idea minefield. Basically its a dumping ground for me of things that I might do, see, think about, plan or find or whatever. My reason being is that I'll just leave them dangling in this minefield until such time that the rest of my brain bumps into them and they explode into a fully realised idea or plan!

Well this is my first post as well as my first steps into the big wide world of blogging 

**_Spooopy!_**

My intention for this site is to be a dumping ground for things that I enjoy as well as to help document & track my progress through my 2020 #PaintingWarhammer journey! 

So far, my 2020 hobby year, like many others I suspect, is gearing up to be a year of finishing off last year's over commitments and starting some new and exciting things. Taking stock of my pile of shame, organising my workspace and clearing out a bunch of _old_ bits that I don't really need anymore despite convincing myself otherwise last year.

As it is late, and I have a crying newborn I think I've done well to get the site setup and running in a day, so given that I don't have a huge amount to say currently, I'm going to go get a drink.

I'll be back soon with something of actual substance. Promise.

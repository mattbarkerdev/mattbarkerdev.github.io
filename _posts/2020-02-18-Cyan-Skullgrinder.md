So for this fella I decided to run against my usual theme of trying to finish a model quickly, well within reason anyway.

I decided to take a lot more time and care over the blending of the armour and followed some of the example blends in the leaflet that came with the Scale75 paints I used for it. Interesting experience them too. Very different to the GW ones. 

I also tried to go over my work much more and not just be happy with the first pass at it all. Tried some wet blending too on the robes and bits which I think added a nice touch as well as restarted me on something I'd tried to do more of a long time ago and not really come back to much since. 

As a theme, I really wanted to keep away from the standard red for this guy. Whilst its iconic, I think that other alternatives stand out more. Maybe just a personal thing, I dunno. 

Either way, I think as a mish mash of new techniques and things I'm happy as progress is being made, I think he's finished to a higher standard than I might have done in the past perhaps and that can only be a good thing!

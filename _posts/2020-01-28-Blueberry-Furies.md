Well this has taken a whole lot longer than expected. I guess I've been busy but that sounds like an exucse I'm not willing to pin on myself yet.

I suppose the reality is that I've been talking my time, thinking about how to improve my painting finish and technique as well as reaching out more to the community for tips and advise. Spoken to some lovely, encouraging and supportive people who have helped provide some invaluble tips and pointers to help me up my painting game in the short time that I've been activly been trying to achieve that. 

In terms of pushing out of my comfort zone - these were predominantly glazed over an underpainted / sketch style finish. Something I've seen done to great effect by Dana Howl in both her twitter and youtube content but that in the past the finer points of it had escaped me. I'm still by no means at that level, but I'd like to think these are a step in the right direction!

In terms of everything else, running is up. Many miles covered this month compared to this time last year so super pleased about that. Weight loss not so much. Seem to be stagnating around the same few pounds that go up and down all the time. Very frustrating, but need to power through. Stupid old body full of Christmas cheese is being stubborn!
